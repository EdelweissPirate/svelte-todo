# Svelte-Todo

###### - Svelte - 

</div>

## Description 

<p>
    Simple Svelte Application to add, remove and toggle user's Todos. User is able to add unique title for each todo and filter between All, Active and Completed entries.
</p>

## Development

<p>
    First time developing with Svelte. Quite taken aback by it's simplicity and ease of use in comparison to React, though I can see why React is useful for more complex applications and sites. This has sparked an interest in recreating one of my React apps in Svelte to compare the end result. Next time I'll try: 
    
    npm create vite@latest myapp -- --template svelte
</p>
